# Discover My Newsletters - MVP Development Guidelines

## 1. Project Scope and Focus

### 1.1 MVP Objectives
- Validate core value proposition: Newsletter discovery and personalization
- Prioritize user experience over comprehensive features
- Build a minimal, functional prototype to gather user feedback
- Keep development agile and iterative

### 1.2 Core Feature Set
- User preference selection
- Newsletter recommendation engine
- Basic search functionality
- Minimal viable user interface

## 2. Technical Constraints and Priorities

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Minimal external dependencies
- Firebase for backend services
- Zustand for lightweight state management

### 2.2 Development Principles
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoid over-engineering
- Implement only essential features
- Optimize for quick iterations
- Maintain clean, readable code

## 3. Code Quality for MVP

### 3.1 Simplification Guidelines
- Prefer simple, direct implementations
- Use mock data for initial development
- Implement basic error handling
- Focus on core user flows

### 3.2 Component Design
- Create reusable, atomic components
- Keep components small and focused
- Minimize prop drilling
- Use functional components with hooks

## 4. State Management

### 4.1 Zustand Store Approach
- Create minimal, purpose-specific stores
- Avoid complex state logic
- Prioritize readability over optimization
- Use for global state and complex interactions

## 5. Performance and Optimization

### 5.1 MVP Performance Considerations
- Implement basic code-splitting
- Use React.memo for critical components
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Defer advanced optimizations

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 MVP Testing Approach
- Focus on critical path testing
- Aim for 50-60% test coverage
- Prioritize integration and end-to-end tests
- Use snapshot testing for UI components

## 7. Error Handling and Logging

### 7.1 Simplified Error Management
- Implement basic error boundaries
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log critical errors
- Avoid complex error recovery mechanisms

## 8. Authentication and Security

### 8.1 MVP Authentication
- Implement basic email/password authentication
- Use Firebase Authentication
- Defer advanced security features
- Protect sensitive user data

## 9. Deployment and Infrastructure

### 9.1 Deployment Strategy
- Use Vercel or Firebase Hosting
- Implement basic CI/CD
- Automate basic deployment checks
- Keep infrastructure simple

## 10. User Feedback and Iteration

### 10.1 Feedback Loop
- Implement analytics to track user interactions
- Create mechanisms for user feedback
- Be prepared to pivot based on early user responses
- Maintain flexibility in design

## 11. Documentation

### 11.1 Minimal Documentation
- Maintain a concise README
- Document key architectural decisions
- Keep inline comments focused and meaningful
- Update documentation with each significant change

## Conclusion

These MVP guidelines are designed to help us rapidly validate our core product hypothesis while maintaining code quality and flexibility. They are intentionally less prescriptive than our previous guidelines, allowing for quick adaptation and learning.
